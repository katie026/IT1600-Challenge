    - 16 bits, 2 bytes
- Rule:
    - Interface speed: bits
    - Data storage: bytes
    - Example: 
        - Service provider has plan that is 100 megabit(Mb)/sec
        - File that is 100 megabytes(MB)
            - 1 megabyte = 1 million bytes
            - 800 million bit file → 100 million bits/sec service → 8 seconds - to download file
    - 100 Mb = 12.5 MB
    - Sometimes speed is represented in bytes
    - B = bytes
    - b = bits
    - bits/10 = bytes (VERY APPROXIMATE)
        - 100 Mb/sec is more like 10 MB/sec (technically 12.5 MB)

## Bit
- The [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) (a portmanteau of binary digit) is a basic unit of - information used in computing and digital communications
- A binary digit can have only one of two values
    - may be physically represented with a two-state device
    - commonly represented as 0 or 1, true/false, yes/no, on/off, or - +/−
- 8 bits = 1 byte, but historically the size of the byte is not - strictly defined
    - 4 bits = 1 nibble
- can be stored by a digital device or other physical system that - exists in two possible distinct states
    - Ex. states of a flip-flop, two positions of an electrical - switch, two distinct voltage or current levels allowed by a - circuit, two distinct levels of light intensity, two directions - of magnetization or polarization, the orientation of reversible - double stranded DNA, etc.
- bitwise operation optionally processes bits one at a time
- Data transfer rates are usually measured in decimal SI - multiples of the unit bit per second (bit/s), such as kbit/s.

    | Value | Metric |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | 1000	| kbit | kilobit |
    | 10002	| Mbit | megabit |
    | 10003	| Gbit | gigabit |
    | 10004	| Tbit | terabit |
    | 10005	| Pbit | petabit |
    | 10006	| Ebit | exabit |
    | 10007	| Zbit | zettabit |
    | 10008	| Ybit | yottabit |
    | 10009	| Rbit | ronnabit |
    | 100010	| Qbit | quettabit |

## Bytes
- binary prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, ...)
- The [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) is a unit of digital information that most commonly - consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number - of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer - and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of - memory in many computer architectures.
- Examples:
    - 32 bits is the same as 4 bytes.
    - 8 bytes is the same as 64 bits.
    - An image that is 230,400 bytes is 1,843,200 bits.
    - A storage device that holds 8,388,608 bits is also said to hold - 1,048,576 bytes.
- Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a - single character of text in a computer
- 8-bit byte as an **octet**
    - bits counted with numbering from 0 to 7
- Systems based on powers of 2, however, might use binary - prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, ...) and their corresponding - symbols (Ki, Mi, Gi, ...) or they might use the prefixes K, M, - and G, creating ambiguity.
- prefixes using powers of 10
    - 1 kilobyte (symbol kB) = 1,000 bytes
    - U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to - be the 'preferred' one for the purposes of 'U.S. trade and - commerce
- units based on powers of 2
    - 1 kibibyte (KiB) = 1,024 (aka 210)  bytes
